## Introduction

RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small, highly optimized set of instructions. The `instruction-interpreter` project is a basic interpreter that allows for the execution of such instruction sets, specifically tailored towards simplicity and educational use.

## Installation

To install this project:

Clone the repository from GitHub.

```
git clone https://github.com/karim-walid-wahdan/instruction-interpreter.git
```
## Usage

After you've installed the project, you can run the interpreter. Detailed usage instructions would be included here, such as how to input instruction sets, what output to expect, and any options or arguments the interpreter accepts.

## Contribution
